  In 2016 my booking fees went up. Not a lot. After having done my 2nd gig for a
  billionnaire, when I discovered that the sound guy was getting more than me,
  Ithought it would not be a bad idea to start pushing the act's rates back up
  to pre-2008 levels. Which is what has happened. I am pleased to have become a
  bit of a regular at the old people's working class lunchtime project, "The
  Posh Club", run by Duckie. It is great fun and a very nice feeling of having
  done something worthwhile when it was all over. I have also started my first
  forays, as a result of this, into daytime Residential Home singing, which is
  similarly nice and gentle and has a different vibe to my usual gigs. Also, in
  2016, ChineseElvis was to be found at Annabelle's Nightclub! ChineseElvis
  appeared at Twycross Zoo with (non-Chinese) Tom Jones! And some monkeys!
  ChineseElvis sold out the famous Rivoli Ballroom on a disco night - something
  that has yet to be replicated! Michael McIntyre, who I have been saying looks
  like me for some years has recently realised this for himself.

To be fair, he does not know I am ChineseElvis, but he recently started his new chat show and his opening monologue used a picture of me he found on the Skype website (who hired me to wave, in dressing gown, at a child I had never met). This is a still from his show. I hope he can't sing very well, or I am literally finished...

ChineseElvis appeared at Latitude Festival. The first Elvis to ever play this (or any) UK rock festival, he played to a packed tent at 1am on on Monday morning. In his head it looked like this: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/524ff8e0-a05a-4be2-9e44-93c6b9c080ba.jpg)

And from ChineseElvis' perspective, it looked like this, which is not so bad.
